Just created a small app - still trying to remember all nim basics, but looks like I totally forgot everything. Okay, nothing bad to start over, right?
So I created a "main" module which can parse command line arguments, as well as forks into two processes - one for server, one for client. Next step will be to connect server and client with something fast and reliable. I've found ENET (http://enet.bespin.org/) - a protocol on top of UDP which is reliable as TCP but not too complicated. Hope I'll find a way to use it in nim. And... I'm really happy to use nim again.
